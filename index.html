            Nice to meet you! I am a passionate full stack developer interested
            in modernizing business applications. Like many others, I was often
            frustrated with apps that were slow and unintuitive. As a fitness
            manager, I began studying fitness systems such as Perfect-mind,
            mind-body, punch-pass, clear, and club-ready to grasp what works and
            what doesn’t from a user perspective. I went back to school to learn
            full stack developing to help bridge the gap and pursue other
            programming interests.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-4 ml-sm-5">
            My non-programming background includes Bachelors in Corporate
            Communications from Bridgewater University. I focused mostly on
            leadership communications. I’m very interested about the gap between
            what people mean to say and what people actually hear. I also
            managed several schools for Elite Freestyle Karate over 7 years.
            When I left, I had over 250 clients and was in charge of a small and
            effective team. I believe my team management experience will be one
            of my strongest assets with any company I team up with.
          </p>

            Fun Story: My positive attitude sometimes gets the better of me. For
            example, I once offered to play a bride down the aisle because her
            pianist quit two weeks before the wedding. I just felt bad and
            really wanted to help. The problem is, I never played piano before.
            I called the church pianist, borrowed some equipment from my
            friends, and practiced every day for two weeks. Luckily, the wedding
            went off perfectly. I told the bride a few weeks later and we had a
            good laugh.
