        Ethan Wager is an experienced manager, life coach, public speaker, and
        more recently, full-stack developer. He spent 7 years on a team growing
        a set of martial arts school in Massachusetts. He was in charge of
        student acquisition, retention, sales, and quality assurance in the
        classroom.
        <br />
        <br />
        One thing that always frustrated Ethan was working with apps that
        couldn't keep up. He spoke with other business owners and found how
        common it was to have apps that were quirky, unwieldy, and slow. Excited
        to help innovate and fix the great divide between business owners and
        their apps, he went back to school to become a full-stack developer. As
        a developer with an bacholers in Communications, he hopes to be the
        missing link on a app development team.
        <br />
        <br />
        A fun fact about Ethan is his can-do attitude sometimes gets the best of
        him. He once offered to play a bride down the isle because her pianist
        quit and the wedding was in two weeks. The problem is he never played
        piano before. He called the church pianist who was horrified and they
        practiced every day for two weeks. Luckily, he pulled it off and learned
        never to to say yes in that particular dilemna again.
