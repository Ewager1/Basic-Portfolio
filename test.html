            I am an experienced manager, life coach, public speaker, and full-stack developer. 
            I spent 7 years on a team growing martial arts school in Massachusetts. I was in 
            charge of student acquisition, retention, sales, and quality assurance in the
            classroom.
            <br />
            <br />
            One thing that always frustrated me was working with apps that
            couldn't keep up with the fast pace I needed. I spoke with other managers
            and business owners, and realized how much room there is for improvement 
            in application experiance and speed. Between my computer engineering knowledge 
            and my Bachelor's degree in Communications, I hope to be the missing link between 
            customer and developer. 
            <br />
            <br />
            A fun fact about me is my can-do attitude sometimes gets the better of me.
            I once offered to play a bride down the isle because her pianist
            quit and the wedding was in two weeks. The problem is I never played
            piano before. I called the church pianist who was horrified. We 
            practiced every day for two weeks. Luckily, I pulled it off and learned
            never to to say yes in that particular dilemna again.
