## Challenges I had in this project

- I created this homework early by accident without knowing bootstrap, then went back and tried to erase css margins and padding and    
  replace with bootstrap spacing instead. It ended up being very challenging, but I was finally able to overcome it by creating a seperate test page and doing it piece
  by piece. 

- I had trouble creating a fluid image with my profile picture. Normally, I would put the image in its own column, and text in a seperate column. However, 
  I was asked to let the text wrap around the image, so I used float-left instead. However, this seemed to clash with the image fluid element. I looked up img-fluid, and learned that it sets width %100 and height auto. So my workaround was to make width %20 which 
  still made the image change size as I changed the screen width. In the future, I will play more with other solutions such as text-wrap 
  and justify-content.
